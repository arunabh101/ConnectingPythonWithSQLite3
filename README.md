# ConnectingPythonWithSQLite3

## About The Project

This project is aimed at understanding the integration of python with SQLite3.

* I have used SQLite studio application for browsing and editing my database file(my_favourite_movies)

* The main.py file contains the code to connect to our database, take input from the user and insert it in our table.
* The retrieve.py file contains the code to retrieve all the data from our table.
* The retrieve_1.py file contains the code to retrieve only the data which is specified by our condition.
